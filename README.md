# Big-Integer-Class-In-C-
In this class we have perform arithmetic operations on two Big Integers.
Big Integers are those integers that cannot be stored in any of the data types. The class 	of Big Integers  is used for mathematical operation which involves very big integer 	calculations that are outside the limit of all available primitive data types.
Functions are
Addition(with short hand notation)
Subtraction(with short hand notation)
Multiplication(with short hand notation)
Divsion(with short hand notation)
Modulus(with short hand notation)
